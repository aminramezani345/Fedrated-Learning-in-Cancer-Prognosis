Lung Cancer Prognosis with Federated Learning
This project aims to develop an AI model for lung cancer prognosis using federated learning, incorporating socioeconomic determinants from diverse healthcare datasets. The project is structured into several components:

Data Preparation (data/README.md, data/preprocess.py):

The data/README.md file describes the data sources, formats, and preprocessing steps.
preprocess.py includes scripts for cleaning, integrating, and formatting electronic health records (EHR) and clinical genetic testing data.
Model Development (models/README.md, models/model.py, models/train.py):

models/README.md details the architecture and rationale behind the AI model.
model.py implements the AI model using TensorFlow/PyTorch, integrating multimodal data inputs.
train.py executes the training process for the AI model using local data.
Federated Learning (federated_learning/README.md, federated_learning/server.py, federated_learning/client.py):

federated_learning/README.md provides instructions for setting up and running the federated learning network.
server.py defines the federated learning server responsible for coordinating model aggregation and distribution.
client.py implements the federated learning client, which trains models locally and sends updates to the server.
Utilities (utils/README.md, utils/helpers.py):

utils/README.md explains utility functions and helper scripts used throughout the project.
helpers.py contains functions for data manipulation, evaluation metrics, and other supporting tasks.
Requirements (requirements.txt):

Lists Python dependencies required to run the project, including libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, and any other necessary packages.
