Usage
Setup:

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation:

Follow instructions in data/README.md to download or generate data.
Execute preprocessing steps using python data/preprocess.py.
Model Training:

Customize models/model.py for your specific AI model architecture.
Train the model locally using python models/train.py.
Federated Learning:

Review federated_learning/README.md for federated learning setup instructions.
Run python federated_learning/server.py to start the federated learning server.
Run python federated_learning/client.py on each participating node to train and send model updates.
Evaluation and Deployment:

Evaluate model performance using metrics defined in utils/helpers.py.
Deploy the trained model for lung cancer prognosis prediction in a clinical or research environment.
Example Code (Placeholder)
models/model.py
python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input

def create_model():
    input_layer = Input(shape=(...))  # Define input shape based on data
    # Define model architecture
    x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_layer)
    x = Dense(32, activation='relu')(x)
    output_layer = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)
    
    model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=output_layer)
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    return model

python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import clone_model
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import SGD
from federated_learning.utils import federated_average, get_clients_data

def main():
    model = create_model()  # Create a centralized model
    optimizer = SGD(learning_rate=0.01)
    clients = get_clients_data()  # Get list of clients and their data
    
    for round in range(NUM_ROUNDS):
        client_models = [clone_model(model) for _ in clients]
        for client, client_model in zip(clients, client_models):
            client_model.set_weights(model.get_weights())
            client_model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
            client_model.fit(client.data, client.labels, epochs=LOCAL_EPOCHS, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE, verbose=0)
        
        federated_average(model, client_models)  # Aggregate models
Conclusion
This project structure and README provide a framework for developing and deploying an AI model for lung cancer prognosis using federated learning. Customize the placeholders with your specific implementation details, data sources, and model architecture to suit your project requirements.
